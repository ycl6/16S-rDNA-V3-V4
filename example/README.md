### Gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease: temporal stability and disease progression

**Project Description**

Aiming to explore the temporal stability of gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease and the potential relationship of microbiota and disease progression, we characterized the gut bacterial communities of 64 Parkinson's patients and 64 control subjects from two stool samples per subject, collected on average 2.25 years apart. Microbial communities were analyzed with amplicon sequencing of the V3-V4 variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene, performed on the Illumina MiSeq platform.

### 16S metabarcoding of bacteria associated with cultured strains of the brown alga *Ectocarpus sp.*

**Project Description**

We examined the bacterial flora associated with 20 cultured strains of *Ectocarpus sp.* from different locations, and recorded both the bacterial diversity associated directly to the alga and that found in the culture medium. Experiments were carried out to amplify an approximately 400 bp fragment of the bacterial 16S comprising the V3 and V4 regions and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform using V2 reagents (2x250 bp reads).
